# Mansoor Protocol â€” Launcher

A tiny static page that copies the **current Mansoor Protocol activation script** and links you to ChatGPT/Claude.

- **Copy Script** button fetches live text from the GitHub Gist (source of truth).
- **Open ChatGPT / Open Claude** buttons to start a new chat and paste.
- Optional **bookmarklet** to auto-insert the script into a new chat with one click.

**Live Script (Gist):** https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Mansoor-Protocol/9ac9c9fb9f0194b62acf486b467e44bf/raw/mansoor-protocol-activation.txt

## How to update the script
Edit the Gist above (keep the same filename). The launcher always pulls the latest automatically.

## Local development
Just open `index.html` in your browser.
